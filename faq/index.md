### Q. What does a contributor ticket mean?

PyCon India is a conference run with contributions from volunteers and supporters from the community. Hence, as organizers, we provide multiple avenues for people to contribute to the event. People can contribute their time by volunteering in the various conference activities. People can also make a financial contribution by purchasing a contributor ticket.

Contributor tickets helps us meet the expenses of running the conference, and in the long run can reduce the dependence on sponsors. People who purchase a contributor ticket will be credited in our blog, towards the end of the conference.

**No**, there will be no student discount on the tickets. Due to the online nature of the conference this year, and to make it more inclusive and easily accessible, we have kept the ticket prices to a bare minumum this year. So, we will not be offering any discount for students on the tickets.
