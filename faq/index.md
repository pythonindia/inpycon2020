## Ticketing FAQ

### Q. What does a contributor ticket mean?

PyCon India is a conference run with contributions from volunteers and supporters from the community. Hence, as organizers, we provide multiple avenues for people to contribute to the event. People can contribute their time by volunteering in the various conference activities. People can also make a financial contribution by purchasing a contributor ticket.

Contributor tickets help us meet the expenses of running the conference, and in the long run, reduce our dependence on sponsors. People who purchase a contributor ticket will be credited in our blog, towards the end of the conference.


### Q. Is there a student discount?

**No**, there will be no student discount on the tickets. Due to the online nature of the conference this year, and to make it more inclusive and easily accessible, we have kept the ticket prices to a bare minimum this year. So, we will not be offering any discount for students on the tickets.
