## Why Should You Sponsor?

### Put Your Business in the Spotlight

Be a part of India’s Premiere conference on using and
developing the Python Programming Language, increasing your
brand exposure and elevating your business identity within the
community. Stand out among the attendees by prominently
displaying your products and marketing material.

### Hiring and Business Opportunities

Get matched with those who could become potential clients or
employees. The conference has a history of attracting smart
folks and businesses from various backgrounds. Get connected,
make your pitch and find the best programmers or clients to
join your ranks!

### Give Back to the Community

Establish your goodwill and show the community that you’re a
reliable partner, willing to support the
ecosystem. Sponsorship is a way of giving back to the
community and thanking them for their support. Your
sponsorship helps PyCon India remain affordable and accessible
to the widest possible audience.

### Low Cost Marketing

Instead of spending a fortune on traditional advertisements,
take a look at our reasonably priced sponsorship slabs and
pick one - letting you be discovered and known to the cream of
the community at maybe half (or even less!) of your marketing
budget.

Have something specific in mind? Please don’t hesitate to ask!
We are more than happy to work with you and tailor the
sponsorship benefits to suit your needs.
